    Quality assurance of serverless applications is more complex than doing it for other runtimes. Engineering teams spend twice as much time for maintaining testing environments and mocking cloud dependencies instead of building a loyal relationship with their customers, <b>assay.it</b> has you covered.

      Engineers reduce uncertainty and raise confidence about the quality by checking applications against known or predictable issues. Serverless testing is often implemented at the level of an individual function rather than the entire application. Unknowns remain undetected and will cause surprising failures together with anxiety. Effortless, continuous “testing in production” is only the solution for zero-risk releases.

  - title: Save time and eliminate your engineering toil.

    description: |
      Mocking and stubbing of cloud dependencies are essential in unit testing of Serverless applications. It becomes a requirement to keep them identical with real services, engineers have to mock nuances of real services. They quickly get out of sync despite the weekly toil maintenance effort. The best effort simulation of the real environment is the real environment itself. Annihilate coding boredom by validating critical paths of applications using automated “testing in production” techniques.  

  - title: Minute of downtime cost customer loyalty

      Customer trust is hard to earn if your Serverless application is glitching. Applications have to serve their customers according to the value it promises and ensure great experience, otherwise customers find another product for their needs. Use an automated solution to continuously detect issues in every change before a full blow outage is slapped on the customer face.

      The absence of a strong typesafe approach on quality assurance development of Serverless applications causes additional overhead and time loss in the development cycle. <b>assay.it</b> is designed to perform a formal proof of the quality using typesafe Behavior as a Code paradigm. Just write pure functional code instead of clicking through UI or maintaining endless XML, YAML or JSON documents.
